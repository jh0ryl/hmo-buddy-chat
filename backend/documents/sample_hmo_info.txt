About HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)

An HMO, or Health Maintenance Organization, is a type of health insurance plan that provides health services through a network of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers.

Key Features of HMOs

1. Network-Based Care: HMOs typically require members to receive care from doctors and facilities within their network.

2. Primary Care Physician (PCP): Members usually choose a primary care physician who coordinates all their healthcare needs.

3. Referrals Required: To see a specialist, members typically need a referral from their PCP.

4. Lower Costs: HMOs often have lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs compared to other plan types.

5. Preventive Care: Most HMOs cover preventive care services at no additional cost.
